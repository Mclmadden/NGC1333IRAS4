### Monday - 7/22

Used `numpy.polyfit()` to obatin parameters for rotation diagram line of best fit
> Calculated the weight values: (widths * amplitude Ïƒ)^-1 

> `np.polyfit(x,y,degree,full=boolean,w=[array])`

> Return of polynomial coefficients in the format of array[m,b] where m = slope and b = y-intercept

```python
import numpy as np

#Fourth through tenth data points
weight = [3.4e-4*0.641,4.1e-4*0.92,4.6e-4*0.73,3.2e-4*0.848,
          5.4e-4*0.86,4.3e-4*0.92,6.1e-4*0.551]
one = 1
w = [one/x for x in weight]
x = [57.07,71.00,87.26,105.84,126.74,149.97,175.53]
y = [30.551180703326107,30.395085249636868,30.15265650494573,30.027473059502565,
     29.792041199312983,29.730666937248277,29.637962651957622]
np.polyfit(x,y,1,full=True,w=w)

# First three data points
weight = [6.4e-4*0.580, 5.6e-4*0.77, 5.5e-4*0.80]
w = [one/x for x in weight]
x = [29.21,36.17,45.46]
y = [31.641926381766012,31.07712206910506,30.740422046193565] 
np.polyfit(x,y,1,full=True,w=w)
```

Returned:
> Polynomial coefficients: array([-8.10619096e-03, 30.9523523]) and array([-0.05564832, 33.21459443])

Used polynomial coefficients to calculate T_rot for both sections 

Used ranges of T_rot on Splatalogue to calculate rotation partition function, Q(T_rot)

Worked on Overleaf report
