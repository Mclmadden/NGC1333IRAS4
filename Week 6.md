### Monday - 7/15

Read K.M. Menten et al.'s *The Centimeter Transitions of E-type Methanol* article 

Read Paul F. Goldsmith and William D. Langer's *Population Diagram Analysis of Molecular Line Emission* article 

Messed around with the Overleaf template
> Tediously, added in all the tables

> Wrote in some equations for the body text 

Side note: Watched a broadcast of a workshop led by a Columbia astronomy grad student! \#RoarLionsRoar

### Tuesday - 7/16

Brian Svoboda realized the correct equation for calculating the radiation temperature:

Radiation temperature = antenna_temperature * 1/mean_value * (1+0.3^2)/0.3^2 

Which would also affect the output for the areas under the Gaussian curves:

Area = radiation_temperature * FWHM

(aperture_area^2 + source_area^2)/source_area^2 = (1+0.3^2)/(0.3^2) = 12.111 

Recalculated the radiation temperatures and areas:

Methanol File | Radiation Temperature (K) | Area Under the Curve (K.km/s) 
---|---|---
`CH3OH_line8` P3 | 34.5683 | 52.5898 
`CH3OH_line8` P2 | 34.5551 | 52.5697
`CH3OH_line8` P1 | 34.5526 | 52.5659 
`CH3OH_line10` | 36.6256 | 55.7197
`CH3OH_line11` | 36.7637 | 55.9297 
`CH3OH_line12` | 35.6886 | 54.2941 
`CH3OH_line13` | 36.6972 | 55.8286
`CH3OH_line14` | 33.3519 | 50.7392
`CH3OH_line15` | 35.7182 | 54.3392
`CH3OH_line16` | 36.7596 | 55.9234 

Opened `NGC1333IRAS4A_CH3OH_line8_m0p3.moment` in Inkscape to draw arrows and label each protostar:

Continued to mess around with the Overleaf template 
> Wrote rough draft of abstract and some of the body text 

> Added various figures to potentially use in final paper

> Created the different sections of the body text: introduction, observations, methods, analysis, discussion, summary

> Added `NGC1333IRAS4A_CH3OH_line8_m0p3.moment` with labels 

### Wednesday - 7/17

No workday due to day-trip tours (including VLA and VLBA antennae climbs!)

### Thursday - 7/18

Awaiting g_u values from Dave McPaters

Awaiting technical details for Observation section of Overleaf report from Brian Svoboda

Worked on Overleaf report

### Friday - 7/19 

### Goals For Next Week
