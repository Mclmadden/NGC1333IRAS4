Read more of Krumholz's *Notes on Star Formation* review

Calculated the weighted averages of side peak centroids and widths in `CH3OH_line8`:

---|Peak 1 | Peak 2 | Peak 3
---|---|---|---
**Width (km/s)** | 2.63033 | 4.69701 | 8.2667 
**Centroid (km/s)** | -4.66584 | 7.54641 | 64.2864
**w (s/km)^2** | 8.57e-3 | N/A | 3.02e-4

Weighted Arithmetic Mean = Σ(x * w)/Σ(w)

> Weighted Width = 2.82 km/s 

> Weighted Centroid = -2.32 km/s 

### Tuesday - 7/2


### Wednesday - 7/3
