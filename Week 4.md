N.B. Short week due to Independence Day

### Monday - 7/1

Read more of Krumholz's *Notes on Star Formation* review

Cleared up confusion surrounding the `CH3OH_line8` offsets, the weighted arithemetic means, and correcting the plot uncertainties

### Tuesday - 7/2

Calculated actual centroids of the side peaks in `CH3OH_line8` using the offsets:
> New centroid = old centroid - offset

> ---| Peak 1 | Peak 2 | Peak 3
> ---|---|---|---
> **Offset (km/s)** | -10.8 | N/A | 57.5 
> **Old Centroid (km/s)** | -4.66584 | 7.54641 | 64.2864
> **Centroid (km/s)** | 6.13416 | 7.54641 | 6.7864 


### Wednesday - 7/3
